# Functional-Languages
The aim of this repository is to gather all the solutions to the difference excercises that have been assigned during the "Functional languages" course of the Master's Degree in Computer Science of the University of Padua. 

Please note that the solutions are provided as-is, without any warranty of their correctness. 

Inside the "Summary" folder you will also find a LaTeX summary about all the arguments that have been taught during the course. It was done by looking at the professor's slides, the course book and the ["Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!" site](http://learnyouahaskell.com) site.

# Installing the Haskell compiler
The compiler used in order to test and run the excercies is the Glagow Haskell Compiler. 
It is freely available inside the [offficial site](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/). 
the last version is available for any operative system at the [download page](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html).
